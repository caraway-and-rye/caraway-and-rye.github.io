* spring onions
* ginger, cut into thin matchsticks
* bird's eye chilli
* Thai basil, optional
* cilantro

### Timing:

Start about 40mins before eating.


### How to make:

Slice the **green onions** finely, chop enough **cilantro** for finishing the dish and pick the leaves of **basil**, if using. Add together to a bowl. Reserve any **cilantro and basil stalks**.

Finely slice enough **chillies** and **garlic** for finishing the dish and set them aside. Rougly chop the rest of chillies and pass the remaining garlic through a press. Add to the cilantro stalks.

Dice a little **ginger** into thin matchsticks and add to the chilli-garlic topping bowl.

Finely slice the **mushrooms** and break the **bok choi** into leaves, if wanted. Set aside.

Select a metal pot large enough for the stock and another for cooking the noodles. Fill the second pot with enough water.

If using **whole spices**, toast them until fragrant in the soup pot. Remove to a bowl.

Start the pasta water so it boils by the time stock is ready.

Fry the **onion** in a little neutral oil (eg. refined sunflower oil). Pour in the **stock** and add the **spices**, **ginger**, **ground garlic**, **chilli slices** and **cilantro/basil stalks**. Boil for a while until flavorful (approx. 15 mins). Before it's ready, season to taste with **fish sauce**, **soy sauce** and **lime juice**. Strain keeping just the liquid and discarding the solid bits.

Add a little neutral oil and **toasted sesame oil** to the empty soup pot and fry/saute the **beef** until it changes color and it's good to eat (medium rare). Season with a little **fish sauce**, **soy sauce** and **lime juice** while it's cooking. Drain the beef discarding any liquid, then wash the pot.

Start boiling the **noodles** according to package instructions. Once done, drain and quickly rinse with cold water for a few seconds.

While the noodles are boiling, return the **flavored broth** to the first pot. Bring to a boil and add in **mushrooms**, **bok choi** and the **chilli-garlic-ginger topping**. Once cooked, stir in the **green onions* and **herbs**.

Dish out noodles and beef, top with pieces of bok choi fished out of the soup, then ladle the mushroom soup on top. Serve immediately.
