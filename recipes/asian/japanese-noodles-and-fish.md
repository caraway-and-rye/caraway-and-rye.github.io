### For the dressing:

* 1 tbsp mirin

### How to make:

Slice the cabbage thinly. Thinly slice the green onion, separating the green and white. Grate the ginger.

Mix the dressing ingredients. The quantities above are for 2 servings. Adjust quantities as needed. Be minful of adding salt while cooking as the food will be coated with this dressing.

Bring to boil a pot of unsalted water and boil the **soba noodles** according to packet instructions.

Fry the **white part of the onion** with the **ginger** for a few minutes. Add the **cabbage** and cook to taste (slightly crunchy). Once cooked enough, mix with the drained noodles and the **dressing**.

Cut the **cod fillets** into square pieces and coat in **flour** seasoned with salt and pepper. Fry in a little oil until done on both sides. Remove to a paper towel to drain.

Divide the cabbage noodles in bowls and top with fried cod. Sprinke with **togarashi** and **onion greens** to taste.


## Tuna with udon noodles

* sushi-grade tuna (approx. 1/2 lb per person)
* sesame seeds
* cilantro
* lime zest
* 1 tbsp mirin
* 1/2 tbsp sesame oil
* 1/2 tbsp brown rice vinegar
* 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
* carrots (1 per person)
* udon noodles

Mix the mirin, sesame oil, vinegar and soy sauce. Coat the tuna in the sauce.

Peel the carrots, then slice into ribbons using the vegetable peeler.

Boil the udon according to package instructions, then rinse under cold water and set aside.

In a large pan, fry the tuna quickly, a few minutes per side. Aim for a nice sear, but not cooked through. Set aside.

Add a little more oil to the pan, if needed, and add in the udon and carrots. Pour in any remaining marinade. Cook for a few minutes. While those cook, slice the tuna.

Divide the noodles on serving plates, sprinkle with lime zest, cilantro and sesame seeds. Place some tuna on top and serve.
