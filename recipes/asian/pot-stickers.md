### For wrappers:
* 300g flour
* 150g water
* salt

### For pork filling:
* 250g minced pork
* 250g cabbage
* small carrot
* 2-3 green onions
* ginger
* garlic
* soy sauce
* mirin, rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil
* pepper

### For dipping sauce:
* soy sauce
* rice vinegar
* minced garlic
* grated ginger
* chopped cilantro


### Make the filling:

Chop the cabbage finely (can use a food processor), sprinkle with salt and rub. Leave to sit for a while, then squeeze the water out using a kitchen towel.

Grate the carrot and ginger and chop finely the green onion (can use a food processor for all of those). Pass the garlic through a press.

Mix the meat, cabbage, carrot, ginger, green onion and garlic. Season with the desired amount of the remaining ingredients.

Cover and keep in the fridge until needed.


### Make the dough:

Mix the flour, water and salt. Bring togeter and add a few more drops of water or a dash of flour until it can be brought together into a stiff dough. Knead (preferably in a mixer) for 8-10 mins until very soft and pliable. Cover in clingfilm and leave to rest for 1h.

Divide in two and roll each piece into a log. Cover again in clingfilm and let rest for 10 mins.

Cut the log at an angle, making little triangles. Flatten them with the palm, then cover them in clingfilm.

Taking a piece at a time, roll thinly into a thin round. Ideally, the edges should be thinner than the middle. Add some filling, pinch the middle closed, then make folds on each side (folding towards the middle). Place each filled dumpling on a tray and cover with a slightly wet kitchen towel.

Repeat until the dough or filling runs out.

Dumplings can be frozen at this stage (40-50 mins in the freezer on a tray, then bagged and vacuum sealed).


### Cook:

Heat a pan, then add a few tsp of fat (frying oil or pork fat). Place dumplings in the pan without over-crowding. Fry uncovered until colored on the bottom. Add a few tbs of water, cover, reduce the heat and steam for 10 mins. 

Make a dipping sauce to taste, using any of the listed ingredients. Serve dumplings with the sauce.
