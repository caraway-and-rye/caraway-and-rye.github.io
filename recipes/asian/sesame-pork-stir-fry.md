Peel and finely chop the ginger. Grate the lemon zest.

Slice the onion into medium-thickness slices.

Finely chop the garlic, or put through a garlic press.

Start cooking the **rice** to serve as a side.

Fry the **fatty cubes of pork** with a little oil until rendered and golden-brown. Remove to a bowl.

In the same pan, add the **ginger** and **onion**. Add also a bit of salt and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the **strips of pork** and the **garlic**. Once somewhat cooked, add the **carrots** and **lemon zest**. Season with **soy sauce**. Once cooked, mix in the **cooked pork cubes**, **mangetout**, **sesame** and **lemon juice** to taste. Mix well and serve immediately.
