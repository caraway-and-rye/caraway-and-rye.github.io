# Shrimp and mushroom green curry


### Ingredients:

* 2 shallots
* cremini mushrooms
* 1 zucchini
* 3-4 green onions
* handful of long beans, optional
* 2-3 tbsp green curry paste
* 1 pound shrimp (peeled and deveined)
* Thai basil
* 1/2 tin coconut milk
* 1 lime
* toasted cashews
* cooked basmati rice, optional


### How to make:

Slice the shallots. Cut the mushrooms in big chunks. Quarter the zucchini and then cut it in big chunks. Chop the green onions and cut the beans in lengths.

Season the shrimp with salt and pepper.

Heat some oil in a pan and add the shallots, mushrooms, zucchini and beans. Fry until they are cooked, but still have some crunch. Remove the vegetables from the pan.

Add the curry to the pan and toast a little. Add also the shrimp and fry until the shrimp are almost cooked. Add the coconut milk and chopped basil and continue cooking until the sauce starts to thicken. Add the vegetables back, sprinkle with the chopped green onion and boil for a minute. 

Serve with lime juice and cashews. Optionally, serve with rice.
