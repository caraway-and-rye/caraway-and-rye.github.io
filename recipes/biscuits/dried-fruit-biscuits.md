# Dried fruit biscuits


### Ingredients:
* butter, 200g, soft
* muscovado sugar, 125g 
* marmalade, 2 tbsp 
* mixed spice, 2 tsp
* cinnamon, 1 tsp
* ginger, 1 tsp
* rolled oats, 175g
* flour, 200g
* baking powder, 2 tsp 
* dried fruit, 275g, mix of prunes, apple, pears and apricots


### How to make:

Mix the **flour**, **spices**, **oats** and **baking powder** in a large bowl. Chop the **fruit**.

Heat oven to 160C. 

Cream the **butter** and **sugar**. Mix the **marmalade** with 2 tbsp boiling water and stir into the butter, then add the flour mix and the fruit. Mix until combined (it will seem dry at first, but it will come together after some mixing).

Place a sheet of cling film on the counter, pile the dough in a row on the middle of the cling film then shape the dough in a log with the help of the cling film. Slice biscuits using a knife dipped in flour before every cut. 

Bake for 20 mins until the biscuits are golden. 

Don't be tempted to over bake or else they will be dry and hard. 

Leave the biscuits to cool on the tray for 10-15 mins as they are very crumbly when hot. While one tray of biscuits is baking, keep the remaining log of dough in fridge. It will then cut easier.
