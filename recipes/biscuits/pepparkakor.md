# Pepparkakor (Swedish ginger thins)


### Ingredients:
* butter, 50g
* muscovado sugar, 2 tbsp
* golden syrup and treacle, 1 tbsp each
* 1-2 tsp ground spices (star anise OR ginger +  cinnamon + cloves + pepper + cayenne)
* flour, 140g
* baking soda, Â¼ tsp 


### How to make:

Put the **butter**, **sugar**, **golden syrup**, **treacle** and **spices** in a pan and heat until melted. 

Sift the **flour** and **soda** into a bowl, then stir in the wet ingredients to form a soft dough. Bring together with your hands into a disc, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 mins.

Heat oven at 180 degrees. 

Roll the dough between sheets of cling film until it's 2-3 mm thick. Cut round biscuits with a 4-6 cm cookie cutter.

Bake for 8-15 mins until firm to the touch. Cool on the tray until they start to harden or else they will bend. 

Serve after completely cooled.
