# Thumbprint cookies


### Ingredients:
* 4 cups barley flour (or 1:1 oat and barley)
* 3 cups almond flour
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 cup oil or melted butter
* 1 cup honey or maple syrup
* jam


### How to make:

Heat the oven at 180 degrees. 

Mix thoroughly the **flour**, **almonds** and **cinnamon**. Add the **oil** and **syrup** and mix to combine. 

Shape tablespoon-sized balls, make a hollow in them with the thumb and place on a tray.
Make the hollow more deep than wide since the cookie will spread a little in the oven.
Fill the hole with **jam** then bake until done (20 mins).
