# American pancakes

### For pancakes:
* 1.5 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1.75 tsp baking powder
* 2 eggs
* 3 tbsp melted butter
* 1 - 1.25 cups milk
* small piece of ghee for frying

### To serve:
* fruit
* maple syrup
* butter

### How to make:

Melt the butter and let cool. Whisk the dry ingredients in a large bowl, add all wet ingredients and whisk until well combined. Pour the batter in a jug or some container easy to pour from.

Heat a large steel pan until very hot. Add a small piece of ghee and coat the bottom of the pan. Pour mounds of batter in the pan and cook pancakes. There is no need to add extra ghee on subsequent pancake batches.

Remove to a plate, add a little piece of butter on top of each pancake, drizzle with syrup and serve with fruit.

If not eating right away, keep warm in a low oven.
