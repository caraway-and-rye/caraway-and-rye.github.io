# Scones

### Ingredients:
* 225 g plain flour
* 1 sachet baking powder
* 75 g butter
* 2 tbsp caster sugar
* 1 egg, beaten
* 90 ml buttermilk

### Timing:

Start making about an hour before eating.

### Makes:

10 scones

### How to make:

Mix the flour with the baking powder and then rub the butter in. Mix with the sugar. Prepare the tray and have the oven warmed up at 200 degrees. Add the egg and buttermilk and mix lightly until it comes together. Do not overwork the dough.

Pat the dough to 2-3 cm and cut rounds with a 5-6 cm diameter cutter. Or, pat in a round shape and cut into 8 wedges. Transfer to the tray and brush the tops with yogurt. Bake for 12-15 mins.

Replace sugar with 75 g grated cheddar and 1 tbsp grated Parmesan.

### Fruit scones 

Add 60 g raisins or chopped dried fruit at the same time with the sugar.

### Ginger scones 

Add 4 pieces of candied ginger, chopped, and a pinch of dried ginger together with the sugar.
