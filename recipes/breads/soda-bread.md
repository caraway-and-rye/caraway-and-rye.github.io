# Soda bread

### Ingredients:
* buttermilk
* quick-cooking oats, 50g
* flour, 75g 
* wholemeal flour (wheat, rye, oat or millet), 175g
* baking soda, 1/2 tsp
* spice, 1 tsp
* sugar, 2 tbsp, *optional*
* dried fruit, a handful, *optional*


### How to make:

Heat oven at 200 degrees and line a large tray with baking paper. 

Mix the **flours**, **oats**, **soda**, **dried fruit**, **sugar** and **spices**. 

Make sure the oven is heated enough. 

Add **buttermilk** and mix without overworking, similar to scones. Place the dough on a well floured work surface and shape in a log. Cut in pieces and place the buns on the tray. Bake until done. If using only wheat flour, it can be left as a log and sliced when baked. Serve preferably warm.


### Sweet oat buns:

Use **oat flour**, freshly ground **anise seeds** as the spice, **muscovado sugar** and no dried fruit. Expect moist, doughy buns.

Serve with butter and tea.


### Cinnamon millet buns: 

Use **millet flour**, **cinnamon**, a handful of **raisins** and no sugar. Expect dry buns (?).

Serve warm with butter, honey and tea or with a Moroccan stew.


### Peach buns: 

Use **wheat flour**, **cinnamon**, a **firm peach** cut in small pieces and a **few chocolate chips**. 

Serve with butter and tea.


### Curry and cheese rye buns: 

Use **rye flour**, **curry powder**, a handful of chopped **mature cheese** and no dried fruit or sugar. Expect dry, dense buns.

Serve with butter and savory food.


### Barley buns:

Use **barley flour**, some salt and no fruit, sugar or spices. Expect moist and doughy buns that firm up by the next day. Very white on the outside.

They are great dipped in melted butter and honey.


### Soda bread without buttermilk

Start heating the oven to 200C.

Crack an egg into a bowl, add some milk and beat them together with a fork. Add in a little salt and sugar if wanted.

In a separate bowl, mix some whole wheat flour (Irish one has bran added in), white flour and some baking powder. Add in any dried spices you want to use and optionally a handful of raisins or other dried fruit.

Dump the flour in the bowl of milk and egg. Mix with a spoon until gathered together. Add extra milk or flour if too dry/wet. Shape into a log on a work surface well dusted with flour. Place on the baking tray and score deeply with a knife. Bake until done.

Serve warm with butter.
