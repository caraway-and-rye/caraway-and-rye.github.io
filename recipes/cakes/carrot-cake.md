### For cake:
* orange, 1, zest and juice
* sultanas, 50g 
* eggs, 2
* muscovado sugar, 110g 
* caster sugar, 30g
* neutral-tasting oil, 150 ml 
* wholemeal flour, 85g
* flour, 100g 
* baking powder, 1 tsp
* cinnamon, 2 tsp
* mixed spice, 2 tsp
* bicarbonate of soda, 1 tsp
* carrots, 140g, coarsely grated
* walnuts, 50g, chopped


### For icing:
* mascarpone, 250g
* icing sugar, 85g
* ground cinnamon, 1 tsp
* walnut halves, 8-10, to decorate


### Timing:

Start cooking about 8h before baking and serve the earliest 1-2 hours after baking.

### Makes:

8-10 slices

### How to make:

Mix the **orange juice and zest** with the **sultanas** and leave overnight or heat and leave to cool. Line a 2 lb. loaf tin with baking paper.

Heat the oven at 180 degrees. 

Mix all the **dry ingredients** together, then add the **remaining ingredients** and mix until combined. 

Tip into the prepared tin and bake for about 1 hour then cool in tin.

Once cool, make the icing by mixing **all icing ingredients** carefully so the mascarpone doesn't curdle. 

If eating all cake the same day, spread on top of the cake and decorate with the walnut halves. If not eating all the same day, keep the cake un-iced in a closed tin at room temperature and keep the icing in the fridge. When eating, spread some of the icing on the cake slices.
