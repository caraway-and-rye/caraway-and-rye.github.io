# Gingerbread Madeleines

### Ingredients:
* 200g brown butter at 110 degrees (start with about 300g of 80% butter so you end up with 200g of brown butter)
* 245g bread flour
* 120g 10x (powdered sugar)
* 10g baking powder
* 245g eggs
* 130g trimoline (inverted sugar or honey)
* 50g milk
* 3g salt
* 3 tbsp gingerbread spice

### Timing:

Make the brown butter first, because it takes a while to cool down to 110 degrees.

### Makes:

One dozen madelines

### How to make:

Mix all ingredients except the brown butter in a mixer. Slowly add the brown butter until smooth. Refrigerate for two hours or over night. Spoon into buttered and floured madeline pans and bake at 325 degrees (160C) until edges are golden brown (10-12 mins).

They are best baked right before needed and served very fresh.

### For a batch of gingerbread spice:

* 2 tbsp ground allspice
* 2 tbsp ground cinnamon
* 2 tbsp ground ginger
* 1 tbsp ground cloves
* 1 tbsp ground nutmeg
* some ground black pepper
