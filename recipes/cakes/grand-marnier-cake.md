#### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Cake:**
    1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
    2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
    3. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.
    4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
    5. Mix in the orange zest and vanilla extract.
    6. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk and Grand Marnier, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.
    7. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and smooth the tops.
    8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
    9. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.

2. **Prepare the Syrup:**
    1. In a small saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
    2. Remove from heat and stir in the Grand Marnier. Let it cool slightly.

3. **Prepare the Frosting:**
    1. In a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy.
    2. Gradually add the powdered sugar, beating until smooth.
    3. Add the heavy cream, Grand Marnier, vanilla extract, and orange zest (if using). Beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.

4. **Assemble the Cake:**
    1. Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Brush the top with half of the Grand Marnier syrup.
    2. Spread a layer of frosting over the soaked cake layer.
    3. Place the second cake layer on top and brush with the remaining syrup.
    4. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.
    5. Decorate as desired (e.g., with orange zest, chocolate shavings, or fresh berries).

5. **Serve:**
    - Slice and serve the cake. Enjoy the rich, silky, and flavorful Grand Marnier cake!
