# Mother's layered honey cake

### For biscuit layers:
* flour, 400g
* honey + sugar, 200g (3 tbsp honey + 150g sugar OR 200g honey)
* butter, 50g butter
* milk, 50g
* egg, 1
* baking soda, 1 heaped tsp

### For filling:
* milk, 500ml
* sugar
* coarse semolina, 100g
* vanilla
* lemon, juice of 1/2 and zest of 1
* butter, 200g, soft
* apricot or plum jam

### Timing:

Make at least the day before serving.


### How to make:

Heat up the oven at 180C.

In a large heat-proof bowl measure the **honey** and **sugar**. Add the **butter**, **milk**, **egg** and **baking soda**. Place the bowl on a pot of boiling water and heat, mixing, until the honey mix doubles in volume. Add the **flour** and mix well.

Leave the dough to cool down a little then divide it in 4-5 pieces. Keep them covered in a warm place or else the dough will harden and it will be hard to work with.

Taking one piece at a time, use a rolling pin to make a thin rectangular sheet. Butter the bottom of a biscuit tray and place the rectangle of dough on it, stretching a little to fit. Bake for about 8 mins until it starts to brown.

While baking the biscuit sheets, make the filling. 

Bring the **milk** with some **sugar** to a boil, then add the **coarse semolina** while whisking continually. Leave to cool for a little, then mix in some **vanilla** essence, the **lemon juice** and **zest**. Let the cooked semolina to cool off completely. Cream the **butter** and then mix in the semolina.

Place a biscuit sheet on a tray, spread with half the semolina filling, then top with another biscuit sheet. Spread with **apricot jam** and top with another biscuit sheet. If you have 2 biscuit sheets left, spread again with apricot jam, and use the remaining semolina as your last layer of filling.

Leave the cake to soften overnight or until it's soft enough to cut (12-36h depending on how thick the biscuit sheets were and how soon after baking they got filled). Cut the cake in small pieces and serve.
