# Muffins

### Ingredients for base recipe:
* butter, 100g, soft at room temperature
* caster sugar, 100g
* milk, 2 tbsp
* plain yoghurt, 140g
* large eggs, 2
* flour, 250g
* baking powder, 2 tsp
* baking soda, 1 tsp

### Makes

12 muffins

### How to make

Mix the sugar, milk and butter using a whisk. Mix them until well combined and the sugar is melting / less gritty. Add also the yoghurt and egss and mix to combine the eggs evenly.

Separately mix the flour with baking pwders.

Heat the oven to 180 C fan (or 200 C regular) and put papers in a 12 hole muffin tray.

Mix all ingredients together (no overworking the dough) and then distribute the dough in the 12 muffin holes. Put in the oven right away. 

Bake for 5 mins, then reduce the oven to 160 C fan (or 180 C regular) and bake 15 mins more.

### Variation: Blueberry muffins

* 125g blueberries
* vanilla essence

Add some vanilla when mixing the wet ingredients. At the very end, after mixing the dough together, mix in the blueberries too and then divide into the 12 muffin holes.

### Variation: Strawberry muffins

* 15 - 35g freeze dried strawberries (we used about 17g)
* vanilla essence

Add vanilla in with the wet ingredients. Mix in the strawberries at the very end before dividing the dough into muffins. Make sure you don't break the strawberries too much when mixing.

### Variation: Lemon muffins

* lemons, 2, zest and juice
* powdered sugar

Mix in the lemon zest with the wet ingredients. Bake the muffins as usual.

Mix the lemon juice with enough powdered sugar to make it taste decent (a bit sour, but not over the top). After the muffins cooled for 5 mins, poke them a few times with a skewer and then pour the lemon juice slowly and evenly over them. Let rest in the muffin tray 10-15 mins, then take out the muffins to a cooling rack (before the sugared lemon juice makes them stick to the pan).
