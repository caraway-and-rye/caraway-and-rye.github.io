In a small bowl, mix the **flour** with the **baking powder** and the **spices**. Melt **75 g butter** and set aside to cool. 

In a large bowl, mix the **caster sugar**, the **egg** and the **orange zest** until smooth and creamy. Pour in the melted butter and the coffee drained from the dates. Mix just a little to combine then sift the flour over and whisk until smooth. Add also the soaked dates with any coffee still left on them and stir to combine. Pour in the prepared jars or cake pan and bake 25-40 mins. Let cool in tin.
