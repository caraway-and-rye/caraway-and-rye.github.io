# Creme patissiere

### Ingredients:
* 2 cups milk
* 2 1/2 tbsp corn starch
* 6 egg yolks (or 3 yolks + 1 whole egg)
* 6 tbsp sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter


### Timing:

Start making at least the day before.


### How to make:

Pour most of the **milk** in a pan and bring to a boil.

Add the **corn starch** on top of the remaining **milk** and let it sink. Stir.

Mix the **yolks** and **sugar**. Add the **vanilla** and milk/starch. Mix well.

When the milk is boiling, pour it slowly into the eggs while whisking all the time. Return the liquid to the pan and bring to a boil on low heat while mixing. Once it's thickened and started bubbling, boil for 1-2 mins more. Add the butter and whisk it in.

Pour in a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm avoiding air bubbles. Let cool at room temperature and then refrigerate until fully cool.

Use as is. The cream is rather soft.

#### Creme legere

Softly whip about **200ml cream**. Add the cold creme patissiere and whip until combined. Use immediately or refrigerate.

#### Bavarian cream

**(find a recipe)** Almost the same as creme legere. It also needs to have gelatin added in. Resulting cream is left to set in molds and can be un-molded.

#### Mandarin jelly with creme legere

Mix **250ml mandarin juice** with **sugar** to taste. Soak **1.5 sheets of gelatin** in cold water. Gently heat the juice until warm enough to dissolve gelatin (but not higher to prevent bitterness). Mix the gelatin in, pour in 6 glasses to about 1/4-1/3. Let set overnight. *(1 sheet of gelatin = very soft set; 2 sheets of gelatin = harder set)*

Top with creme legere and refrigerate until serving.
