# Lemon pudding

### Ingredients:
* 2-5 lemons, limes or grapefruit (made into 1-2 tbsp of zest + 100 ml juice)
* 50g butter
* 200g caster sugar
* 3 eggs, separated
* 50g flour
* 200-250 ml milk
* icing sugar for dusting, *optional*


### Timing:

Start cooking about 1h before serving.

### Makes:

4 servings

### How to make:

Heat the oven at 180 degrees and boil the kettle. Butter a heat-proof dish and get ready a roasting tray large enough to contain the pudding dish.

Cream the **butter** and **sugar**. Mix with the **zest**, **juice**, **egg yolks** and **flour**. The mix may look a little curdled. Separately, beat the **egg whites** to soft peaks then mix carefully with the citrus mixture. 

Pour into the prepared dish, pour boiling water in the roasting tray so it comes half-way up the pudding dish. Bake for 35-40 mins until it's golden on top, but still creamy at the bottom. 

Serve immediately.
