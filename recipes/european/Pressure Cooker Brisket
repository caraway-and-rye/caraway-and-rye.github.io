# Pressure Cooker Brisket

### Ingredients:

 * Brisket: 3-4 lbs (1.4-1.8 kg) of well-marbled brisket, trimmed of excess fat
 * Salt: 2 tablespoons of kosher salt
 * Pepper: 1 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper
 * Olive Oil: 2 tablespoons of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil
 * Onions: 2 large onions, thinly sliced
 * Garlic: 6 cloves, minced
 * Carrots: 2 large carrots, chopped into 1-inch pieces
 * Celery: 2 stalks, chopped into 1-inch pieces
 * Tomato Paste: 2 tablespoons
 * Red Wine: 1 cup of full-bodied red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon)
 * Beef Stock: 2 cups of homemade or high-quality beef stock
 * Bay Leaves: 2 bay leaves
 * Thyme: 4 sprigs of fresh thyme
 * Rosemary: 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
 * Balsamic Vinegar: 2 tablespoons of aged balsamic vinegar
 * Dijon Mustard: 1 tablespoon
 * Miso Paste: 1 tablespoon of red miso paste (adds umami depth)
 * Brown Sugar: 1 tablespoon
 * Worcestershire Sauce: 1 tablespoon
 * Soy Sauce: 1 tablespoon (use low sodium if preferred)
 * Butter: 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
 * Fresh Parsley: 2 tablespoons, chopped for garnish

### Instructions:

1. Season the Brisket:
 * Generously season the brisket on all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
2. Sear the Brisket:
 * Set your pressure cooker to the sauté function (or high heat if using a stovetop model). Add the olive oil and heat until shimmering.
3. Sear the brisket on all sides until deeply browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. This step is crucial for flavor. Once seared, remove the brisket and set it aside.
Sauté the Vegetables:
In the same pot, add the onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté until the onions are caramelized, about 8-10 minutes.
Add the garlic and tomato paste, cooking for another 2 minutes until fragrant and slightly caramelized.
Deglaze the Pot:
Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce by half, about 5 minutes.
Add Aromatics and Liquid:
Stir in the beef stock, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, miso paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. Mix well to combine.
Pressure Cook:
Return the seared brisket to the pressure cooker, nestling it into the liquid and vegetables.
Secure the lid and set the pressure cooker to high pressure for 75 minutes.
Natural Release:
Once the cooking time is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes before performing a quick release for any remaining pressure.
Rest and Reduce Sauce:
Carefully remove the brisket from the pressure cooker and let it rest on a cutting board, tented with foil.
Set the pressure cooker back to the sauté function. Remove the bay leaves and herb sprigs, and simmer the cooking liquid for 10-15 minutes to reduce and concentrate the flavors. Stir in the butter to finish the sauce.
Slice and Serve:
Slice the brisket against the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Arrange on a serving platter.
Spoon the reduced sauce and vegetables over the sliced brisket. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley.
