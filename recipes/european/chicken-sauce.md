# Chicken with cream sauce

### Ingredients:
* boneless, skinless chicken breast
* shallot (1 for every 2 chicken breasts)
* garlic cloves (3-4 for every 2 chicken breasts)
* flour
* chicken stock
* cream or milk

### For lemon and marsala chicken
* a lemon
* some marsala

### To serve:
* bread, rice or pasta
* salad

### How to make the chicken:

Slice the chicken breasts horizontally to make 2 thinner pieces out of each breast. Chop the shallot finely and put the garlic through the press.

Put the stock to boil in a small pan so it's hot when the chicken is cooked.

Salt and pepper the chicken on each side and fry on medium heat in a little oil until golden on both sides. Cook in batches if needed. Remove from the pan and add the shallot and garlic in its place. Fry until translucent. Sprinkle some flour and cook a minute. Add a little hot soup, stirring. Add slowly all the soup stirring to break any clumps. Bring the sauce to a boil and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add cream or milk and boil another minute. Check the sauce for seasoning and add some extra pepper. Return the chicken pieces to the pan and thourougly reheat.

Serve with bread and salad.


### For the lemon and marsala version:

After adding the cream to the sauce and boiling it for a minute, grate some lemon zest in, add some marsala and lemon juice to taste. Mix well, then add the chicken in and continue as usual.
