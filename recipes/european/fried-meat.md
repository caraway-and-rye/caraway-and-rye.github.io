# Fried meat

### For all recipes:
* chunks of meat (skinless fish fillet cut into chunks; chicken pieces; steak/veal/pork pounded thin)
* oil for frying


### Buttermilk coating:
* egg
* buttermilk
* hot sauce
* flour

### How to make buttermilk coating:

Beat the **egg**. Add **buttermilk**, a little **hot sauce**, **salt and pepper** and mix well. You need roughly 1:2 volume of egg to buttermilk.

Mix **flour** with **salt and pepper** and set aside. Also get the **meat** ready and start heating the oil.

Dip the meat in flour, then buttermilk mix, then flour again. Cook until done.

If the meat is very dry already, you can skip the first flour coating.

Good with hake, chicken strips or steak pounded thin (chicken fried steak = aka. steak fried like chicken).
