# Fried meat

### For all recipes:
* chunks of meat (skinless fish fillet cut into chunks; chicken pieces; steak/veal/pork pounded thin; shrimp)
* oil for frying


### Buttermilk coating:
* egg
* buttermilk
* hot sauce
* flour

### How to make buttermilk coating:

Beat the **egg**. Add **buttermilk**, a little **hot sauce**, **salt and pepper** and mix well. You need roughly 1:2 volume of egg to buttermilk.

Mix **flour** with **salt and pepper** and set aside. Also get the **meat** ready and start heating the oil.

Dip the meat in flour, then buttermilk mix, then flour again. Cook until done.

If the meat is very dry already, you can skip the first flour coating.

Good with hake, chicken strips or steak pounded thin (chicken fried steak = aka. steak fried like chicken).


### Breaded:
* egg
* bread crumbs
* flour

Prepare the meat and season well on all sides. If any special dry seasoning is needed, add it now.

Set out 3 bowls for dipping the meat:
* bowl 1: flour
* bowl 2: beaten egg
* bowl 3: breadcrumbs

Coat the meat in flour, then beaten egg, then breadcrumbs. Heat the oil and fry the meat until done.

It's not needed to season the breading since the meat is well seasoned and the breading is thin enough.

Good with veal, chicken or shrimp.
