# Minced beef Wellington

### Ingredients:
* 1 lb minced beef
* 50g tomato ketchup
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* small handful sage, chopped
* handful parsley, chopped
* 15g butter
* 100g mushrooms, finely chopped
* 250g pack puff pastry
* bunch of baby broccoli 
* 2 garlic cloves, sliced


### How to make:

Save a bit of the **beaten egg** for brushing the pastry (dilute with some water). Heat oven at 200C.

Mix **beef**, **ketchup**, the **remaining egg**, **onion**, **half the garlic**, the **herbs** and **50ml water** until the meatloaf mix is well combined. Form into a sausage shape 15cm x 10cm and bake for 15 mins (consider cooking longer so the pastry doesn't have to baked 50 mins). Let cool.

Fry the **mushrooms** in **butter** until not watery. Add the **remaining garlic** and fry just a little longer.

Roll the pastry, brush with egg, add a layer of mushrooms (aim to have them just under the meatloaf), add the meat in the center. Cut the pastry into strips from the meat outwards. Use those to criss-cross and cover the meatloaf in a 'braided' pattern. Brush with more egg.

Bake 50 mins. Cover with foil after about 30 mins if it's browning too much.

Once the Wellington is almost done, pan fry the **broccoli** and flavor with **sliced garlic**.
