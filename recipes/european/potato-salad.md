# Potato salad

### Base recipe:
* potatoes
* *bay leaves, optional*
* eggs
* mustard
* mayo
* white wine vinegar
* salt & pepper

Boil the potatoes whole (or in chunks if in a hurry). Use bay leaves in the boiling water if wanted. Boil also the eggs (7min for soft, 10 for hard boiled). Let them cool then peel and cut into chunks. If the eggs are soft boiled, cut them on top of the potatoes so the soft yolk is coating the potatoes instead of pooling at the bottom of the bowl. Add some mustard, vinegar, salt, pepper and mayo then mix until done.


### With chives:

Mix in a bunch of finely chopped chives at the same time with the mayo.


### With celery and shallot:

Peel the outer strings from 2-3 stalks of celery. Also peel a shallot and dice both finely. Mix in the potato salad.
