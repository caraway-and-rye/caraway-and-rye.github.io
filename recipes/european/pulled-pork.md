# Pulled pork

### Ingredients:
* 2 kg pork shoulder (usually sold as pork butt for and meant for mincing)
* 1 onion
* 5-6 garlic cloves
* fresh thyme
* salt
* vinegar

### Spice rub:
* black pepper
* black mustard
* oregano
* pimenton (smoked paprika)
* chilli powder
* brown sugar

### To serve:
* coleslaw
* bread
* BBQ sauce


### How to make:

Grind any whole **spices** for the rub and mix them with the ground ones. Mix also with **sugar**.

Cut the **pork** in palm-sized chunks. Layer them in a bowl sprinkling with salt and spice rub. Let sit for a few hours.

When ready to cook, chop the **onion** (not too finely). Brown the pork in batches in the pressure cooker pot on sautee mode. Keep in mind that the sugar will tend to burn on the bottom of the pot, so don't do them on the highest setting. Once all pork is browned, add the onion, **garlic** put through the press, all the **marinating liquid** released by the meat and 2 cups of **water** (use it ro rinse the marinade off the bowl and meat juices from browning). Add a bunch of **thyme** to the pot. Cook on high for 90 mins and then let release pressure for 30 mins.

Heat the oven to 200C. Fish out the pork from the pot and place on a tray. Crush a bit with a spoon, add some **BBQ sauce** on top and spread it with a brush to cover the pork evenly. Bake until the pork has a few browned corners.

While the pork is baking, strain the cooking liquid into a saucepan and press the solids through the sieve with a spoon (so the onion and garlic is mashed into the sauce and not thrown away). Cook on high heat to reduce. Adjust the taste with **vinegar**; it will be very sweet, but shouldn't be too salty if you haven't been too heavy handed with salt sprinkling. Boil until reduced to a sauce consistency.

Once the pork is out of the oven, break it apart using 2 forks.

Serve with coleslaw, bread, extra BBQ sauce and the meat sauce.
