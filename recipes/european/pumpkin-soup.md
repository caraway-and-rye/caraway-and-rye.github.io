# Pumpkin Soup

### Ingredients:
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 2 onions, finely chopped
* 1kg pumpkin or squash (try kabocha), peeled, deseeded and chopped into chunks
* 700ml vegetable stock or chicken stock
* 142ml pot heavy cream

### To serve:
* wholemeal seeded bread + handful pumpkin seeds + olive oil
* bacon + sage leaves + wholemeal bread


### How to make:

Heat the stock.

Fry the onion in oil until soft. Add the pumpkin and continue cooking for about 10 mins. Add the stock, salt and pepper and simmer until the pumpkin is cooked. Add the cream and simmer a few more minutes.

Take off the heat and let cool a little then blend to a fine puree.

Let cool and serve.

### Toppings:

For bread and pumpkin seeds, cube the bread then toast it in olive oil until slightly browned. Mix with pumpkin seeds and serve as topping for the soup.

For bacon and sage, chop and fry the bacon. When it's almost done, add the sage leaves and fry in the bacon fat until crispy. Take out the bacon and sage carefully so the sage doesn't crumble. Add the cubed bread to the pan and toast until the bacon fat was absorbed and the bread is browned. Serve the bread, bacon and sage as topping for the soup.
