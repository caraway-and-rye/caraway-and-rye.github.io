# Simple side salads

### Kale salad:
* kale
* shallot
* parmesan
* balsamic vinegar
* olive oil

Shave some parmesan using a vegetable peeler. Chop the kale into chunks. Thinly slice the shallot.

Toss the kale and shallot with vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. Let sit for 15-30 mins.

Stir to re-combine with the dressing and gently mix in the shaved parmesan.

Goes very well with lasagna or Bolognese pasta.


### Radish + green onion + cucumber salad:
* bunch of spring radishes
* bunch of green onion
* 1 hothouse cucumber (or a handful of Persian cucumbers)
* white wine vinegar
* olive oil

Slice the onion diagonally to get long pieces (longer than the diameter of the cucumber). Slice the radishes and cucumber, ideally keeping the cucumber skin. Dress with salt, pepper, white wine vinegar and olive oil.


### Arugula and radicchio salad:
* 3-4 handfuls of arugula
* small radicchio
* parmesan
* balsamic vinegar
* olive oil

Slice the radicchio. Toss with the arugula, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Shave parmesan with a vegetable peeler and gently mix in.
