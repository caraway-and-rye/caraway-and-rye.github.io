# Gajar Matar Sabzi (Carrots and peas)


### Fresh ingredients:
* 5 carrots
* 1 cup green peas
* 2 medium onions
* *2 chopped tomatoes, optional*
* piece of ginger
* garlic
* *lemon, if not using amchur*
* curry leaves
* cilantro

### Pantry ingredients:
* oil or ghee

### Spices:
* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1/2 tsp mustard seeds
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1/4 tsp red chilli powder
* 1/2 tsp amchur (mango powder)
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* garam masala


### Prep:

Wash the carrots and cut into slices. They will steam with no extra liquid so they need to be thin enough.

Measure and set out the peas.

Make the ginger-garlic paste.

Chop finely the onions.

Measure the ground spices together, except garam masala.


### Cook:

Set a pot on high heat. Once hot, add in **2 tbs of oil or ghee** and the **cumin and mustard seeds**. Let them sizzle and pop a little, then add the **curry leaves** and **chopped onions**. Reduce the heat to medium and fry for 2-3 mins. Then add the **ginger-garlic paste** and fry until the raw smell goes away. If using **tomatoes**, add them in now and fry them a little, too. Then add the **ground spices** and mix well.

Reduce the heat to low, add in the **carrots**, mix them with the masala, then cover the pot and let them steam without adding any extra liquid. Once the carrots are half-done, add in the **peas** and cover the pot again. Cook until done (al-dente carrots, cooked peas).

If no amchur was used, add in **lemon juice** (from about half a lemon), add a sprinkling of **garam masala**, **chopped cilantro** and adjust for salt.

Serve with dal and rice, roti or paratha.
