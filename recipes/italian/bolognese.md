| **Extra virgin olive oil** | 1/4 cup | 1/2 cup | 1 1/4 cups |
| **Butter** | 2 tbsp | 4 tbsp | 10 tbsp |

### Preparation:
1. In a 6- to 8-quart heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat until the butter has melted.
2. Add the ground meat and pancetta. Increase the heat to high and brown the meat, stirring frequently. Once browned, reduce the heat to medium and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, or until the fat has rendered. There may be a shallow pool of fat in the pan but do not drain off or discard.
3. Add the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic. Season with salt and cook until the vegetables are translucent but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.
4. Add the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the color is rusty orange.
5. Add the milk and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Add the wine and bring the mixture to a boil.
7. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 2 to 3 hours. Stir occasionally and take care to not burn the ragu. If the ragu appears dry over the 2 to 3 hour simmer, stir in 1/4 cup of water as frequently as needed.
8. Add salt to taste, remove from heat and let cool.
9. The ragu can be stored in an airtight container for 1 week in the refrigerator or frozen for up to 6 months.

### To serve:
* 1 1/2 pounds fresh pasta or 1 pound dry pasta per 6 servings
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano per 6 servings
* 1/4 cup parsley, minced per 6 servings

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. For fresh pasta, cook for 1 minute and drain, reserving the pasta water. For dried pasta, cook for 3 minutes less than package instructions for al dente. Drain and reserve the pasta water.

Per serving, add about 3/4 cup ragu in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the par-cooked pasta and about 1/4 cup reserved pasta water. Stir to coat pasta and cook until the pasta is al dente, adding more pasta water as needed. Serve garnished with minced parsley and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.
