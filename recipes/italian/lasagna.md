# Lasagna

### Makes:

A pan of 40 x 30 cm. (needs to be measured)


### Meat sauce:
* Bolognese OR Amatriciana



### Pasta:
* 12 eggs (4 whole + 8 yolks)
* flour as needed

Whisk the eggs with a fork, add flour and mix until the dough is ready to knead. Turn everything to a work surface, scrape the bowl and fork then knead it for 5-10 mins. Add extra flour if it gets too sticky.

Cover in plastic wrap and set in the fridge for a while (do not leave overnight or else it browns on the outside).

Get the pasta water to boil.

Roll out the dough, cut into palm-sized rectangles and boil for 3 mins. Place the boiled pasta into a large bowl of cold water and assemble the lasagna right away.

Layers:
* pasta
* white sauce
* parmesan
* meat sauce
* ... repeat ...


### White sauce:
* 2l milk
* optional, 4-5 bay leaves + a few cloves + an onion cut into chunks
* 130g butter
* 130g flour
* nutmeg

Add the milk and spices, if using, to a pan and bring to a boil. Let infuse for a while and strain the milk and discard the solids. Bring back to a boil when ready to make the sauce.

Melt the butter in a pan, add the flour and mix until combined. While whisking, start pouring hot milk in. Whish until combined adding more milk as needed until all the milk is added in. Boil for 2-3 mins then add salt and grated nutmeg to taste.


### To assemble:
* grated parmesan


### Timing:

All in all, this would take a whole day. Making the meat sauce in advance, freezing and reheating it before assembling the lasagna brings the timing to half a day.
