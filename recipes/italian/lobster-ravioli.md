# Brown Butter Lobster Ravioli with Tomato Cream Sauce

### Pasta:

* 1 pound fresh pasta dough

### For lobster ricotta filling:
* 3 large lobster tails
* 1 lb peeled shrimp
* 1 stick butter
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* 1 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* salt + pepper

### For the tomato cream sauce:
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/2 onion
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 cans passata
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup chopped parsley
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan
* salt + pepper


### How to make:

Make the pasta dough. Cover in plastic wrap and set in the fridge to rest.

Remove the **lobster** meat from the shells. Peel the **shrimp**, if not peeled already. Steam both in a sieve over a pot of boiling water. It should take 4-7 mins. Check from time to time so they are not overcooked. Chop finley or put through a food processor. You need mince, not paste.

Make **brown butter**. As soon as it's done, add the **garlic** in and mix well. Let cool for a bit, then add **all the other filling ingredients** and mix well. Season to taste.

Make the sauce: Fry the **onions** in **butter** and **oil**. Add the **minced garlic** and cook for another minute. Add also the **tomatoes** and simmer for 15-20 mins. Mix in the **cream** when done.

Roll the pasta and make raviolis. Keep them covered while making the remaining batches. You can freeze them uncooked at this point.

If using right away, boil them in salted water for about 2 mins until they float. Remove carefully from the water and add to the sauce. Add also **parsley** and **parmesan** and mix gently. Serve with extra parmesan on top.
