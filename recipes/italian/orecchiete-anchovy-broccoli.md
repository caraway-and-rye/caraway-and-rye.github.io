# Orecchiete with anchovy and broccoli


**Orecchiette con cime di rapa**

A pasta dish traditional in Puglia.


### Ingredients:
* orecchiete (approx. 250g for 2 people)
* 4-5 garlic cloves
* 6-7 anchovies
* 1-2 tsp oil (use oil from the anchovies if available)
* 1 chilli
* a bunch of tenderstem broccoli or a smaller head of regular broccoli
* pecorino or parmesan


### Timing:

All in all, this should take about half an hour.


### How to make:

Grate some pecorino, peel and mince the garlic, chop the chilli and clean the broccoli.

If using tenderstem broccoli, cut the stems into bitesize lengths and keep the floretes whole. If using regular broccoli, trim it into floretes then halve or quarter them to make smaller pieces.

Start the pasta water in a pot big enough to also fit the broccoli. When it boils put the **pasta** in and set a timer (11-12 minutes).

Start frying the **minced garlic**, **anchovies** and **chilli** in the oil. Break the anchovies into a paste while stirring.

When the pasta timer has about 2 mins left, add the **broccoli** on top of the pasta and make sure it's all covered. When the timer is done, strain the pasta and broccoli, keeping a bit of the water, and add them to the pot of anchovy-garlic. Add also a handful of **grated cheese** and stir until well combined.

Serve with extra grated cheese.
