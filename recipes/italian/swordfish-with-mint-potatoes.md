# Swordfish with mint and potatoes


**Pesce spada steccato e grigliato + Patate in agrodolce**

### Ingredients for the fish:
* 2 swordfish or tuna steaks, 2cm/¾in thick
* 100ml dry white wine
* 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
* 1 garlic clove
* 8 fresh mint leaves
* 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving
* a little fresh oregano or finely chopped flatleaf parsley, to serve
* 1 lemon, preferably organic, quartered

### Ingredients for the potatoes:
* 50g salted capers
* 2 large yellow potatoes, cut into chunks or thin slices
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 3-4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* a handful large unpitted green olives
* 1 tsp caster sugar
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar

### Timing:

2h

### Makes:

4 servings

### How to make:

Wash the fish steaks and pat dry with kitchen towels. Rub with pepper on both sides, but do not salt as it would draw out the juices. Chop the mint and garlic and mix them with the wine and vinegar. Marinate the fish for an hour in the wine and vinegar.

Heat the grill. Remove the fish from the marinade and pat dry.

Brush one side of each fish steak with olive oil, place oiled side down on the grill. When turning the fish, brush with oil the other side. When the fish is cooked it should be moist inside, with white flesh that flakes easily.

Take the fish off the heat and season both sides, drizzle with olive oil, scatter with the herbs and serve with the lemons to squeeze over.

Mix the potatoes and onion, season with salt and pepper and gently fry in the olive oil in a wide non-stick sauté pan. Cut strips from the olives, working round the stone to remove all the flesh, then add to the potatoes with the capers. Dissolve the sugar in the vinegar and add to the potatoes in the pan. Bring to the boil, cook for a minute, then remove from the heat. Serve lukewarm.
