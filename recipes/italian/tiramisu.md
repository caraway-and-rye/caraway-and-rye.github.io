# Tiramisu


### Ingredients:
* savoiardi (lady fingers), 12 pieces
* mascarpone, 250g
* caster sugar
* egg yolks, 2
* fresh coffee
* marsala or amaretto
* cocoa


### Timing:

Start cooking at least 1h 30 min before serving.

### Makes:

2-4 servings

### How to make:

Prepare the **coffee** and sweeten it slightly while hot. Add **marsala or amaretto** to taste. Let cool down.

Mix the **egg yolks** with some **sugar**. Add the **mascarpone** and mix it in. Sweeten to taste.

Get two dessert plates ready to assemble the tiramisu. Soak 6 lady fingers in coffee and place 3 on each plate. Pile a quarter of the mascarpone on each set of lady fingers and spread evenly with a knife. Soak and arrange the other 6 lady fingers and spread with the rest of the filling. Dust with a generous amount of **cocoa**.

Refrigerate until serving.


### Without raw egg yolks:

Prepare half a recipe of Creme patissiere. Cool and then chill in the fridge until cold. Mix with the mascarpone and use. Make sure to make the cream with a bit of extra milk or else the tiramisu will harden too much in the fridge.
