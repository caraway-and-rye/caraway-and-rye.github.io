# Fajitas

### Ingredients:
* flap/skirt/flank steak OR chicken breasts
* red onion
* bell pepper

### Marinade:
* sliced chillies
* 1 tbsp chipotle (or smoked paprika)
* 1 tbsp ground coriander
* pinch of cumin
* oregano
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* juice of 1 lime

### To serve:
* tortillas
* avocado or guacamole
* sour cream
* chopped cilantro
* chopped green onion
* chopped tomatoes or salsa
* queso fresco
* lime wedges

### Timing:

Start making 1-2 hours before. Can refrigerate uncooked leftovers and cook the next day.


### How to make:

Slice the **meat, onion and pepper** into strips. Mix with all the **marinade** ingredients and **salt**  and refrigerate until needed.

When ready to eat, get ready all wanted **toppings**. Set aside a wide pan to heat the tortillas. 

Heat a pan or wok until hot. Add a bit of oil and 1-2 portions of the marinated mixture to the pan and cook on high heat. Cover if needed so it cooks enough without burning.

At the same time heat 1-2 tortillas. Top with cooked meat and toppings. Serve right away.

If more is needed, cook more batches (don't overcrowd the pan so the meat doesn't boil, but fry).

If using corn tortillas, you can heat a stack of them one after the other and keep them warm in a kitchen towel.
