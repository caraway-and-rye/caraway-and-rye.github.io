Leave to cool and then blend to a puree. Add the chopped **cilantro** in and mix it well.

Keep the salsa refrigerated until needed.

For the fish, start by chopping the **cilantro** and **jalape単o**. Add them to a bowl and then mix in the **oil**, **lime** juice and **chili powder**. Cut the fish in chunks and add to the bowl.
