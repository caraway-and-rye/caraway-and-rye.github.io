# Moroccan lamb with apricots, almonds & mint

### Ingredients:
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 550g lean lamb, cubed
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 700ml lamb or chicken stock
* grated zest and juice 1 orange
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 tsp clear honey
* 175g ready-to-eat dried apricots
* 3 tbsp chopped fresh mint
* 25g ground almonds
* 25g toasted flaked almonds
* steamed broccoli and couscous, to serve


### How to make:

Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole. Add the lamb and cook over a medium-high heat for 3-4 minutes until evenly browned, stirring often. Remove the lamb to a plate, using a slotted spoon.

Stir the onion and garlic into the casserole and cook gently for 5 minutes until softened. Return the lamb to the pot. Add the stock, zest and juice, cinnamon, honey and salt and pepper. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat, cover and cook gently for 1 hour.

Add the apricots and two-thirds of the mint and cook for 30 minutes until the lamb is tender. Stir in the ground almonds to thicken the sauce. Serve with the remaining mint and toasted almonds scattered over the top.
