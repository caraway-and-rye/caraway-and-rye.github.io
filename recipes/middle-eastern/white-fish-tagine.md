# Jamie's white fish tagine


### Ingredients:
* 1 lemon
* 3-4 sprigs of mint, leaves picked and stalks preserved
* 150 g couscous
* 2-3 garlic cloves
* a small handful of olives, stone in
* 2 tsp Harissa
* 2-4 anchovy fillets
* 350 g passata
* 240 g white fish fillet, skin off
* a pinch of turmeric
* 1 tbsp sesame seeds, toasted
* 2 medium carrots
* 2-4 clementines
* a few sprigs of parsley or coriander
* small pot of yogurt


### How to make:

Boil the kettle. Put the couscous in a bowl with the mint stalks and a quarter of the lemon, sliced. When the kettle boils, pour enough boiling water over the couscous (2 times the volume of the couscous) and cover it.

In the meantime, pour a little oil in a non-stick pan and place it on medium fire. Add the garlic, olives, Harissa, anchovy, passata and half the lemon, sliced, and bring it to a boil. Stir it once, then nestle the fish in, sprinkle the fish with the turmeric, cover the pan and let boil shaking the pan from time to time so it doesn't stick.

Put the sesame in another pan and let toast on low heat until it starts to color. Coarsely grate the carrot and squeeze the remaining lemon quarter over it. Add also olive oil, the sesame seeds, the chopped parsley and salt and mix it well. Place in the serving bowl(s). Slice the clementines and arrange on top of the salad.

Fluff up the couscous and arrange on a plate. Serve with the fish in tomato sauce, carrot salad and yogurt.
